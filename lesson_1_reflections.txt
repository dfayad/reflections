How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Quicker bug fixing

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually chooseing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved like Google Docs does?
+More logical steps
-You could forget to commit, or you could commit unapropoertly.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
So you can keep track of multiple files that are related or depend on each other.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
use log to see all of the commits
use diff to see the changes between commits


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
It won't make make it as difficult for me to fix bugs that greatly modify things
